# BabyGame01
A simple Android game written in Kotlin for babies who want to change colors.
These are the first steps for me of exploring Kotlin on Android.

This example project uses a custom view, a canvas and a non-UI-thread to draw a 30-FPS full-screen app.
Features:
* draws a color in fullscreen
* fades between a predefined stack of colors when you tap/click it
